Playgrounds &amp; Mini project

Welcome everyone to my repository.
I have two main folders, an active and inactive folder. I created them in my free time. Currently, I focus on polygon art and machine learning.

For the first folder, it contains mini programs and photos about what I'm interested and also some applications is developing.
Next, the inactive folder contains everything that I learned and tried since I was in university.

In machine learning, the following list is what I'm interested in.
1. Reinforcement Learning
2. Deep Learning and Neural Network
